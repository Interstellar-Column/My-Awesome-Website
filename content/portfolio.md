### Heavenly-Cyberspace
This is the current website your now viewing built using HUGO & the "typo" theme by tomfran.
The website & relevant files are hosted on https://github.com/Interstellar-Column/My-Awesome-Website. It took a total of 5 days to build (including learning syntax,directory structure etc).

This website first started off being written in Good Ol' HTML5 & CSS. However the pace of development was too slow + uploading new content was a hassle. It was pretty simple with very minimal font and alignment CSS styling which did the trick but as previously mentioned, is not sustainable.

### CS50P - In Progress
I am currently completing the CS50 Python course which involves creating various programs in Python. Being able to write in Python is a good skill sure but it mainly is providing an understanding of how human written computer programs interact with computers and the relevant hardware. My final project will be uploaded to my portfolio page once completed.
