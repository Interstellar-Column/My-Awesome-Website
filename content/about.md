I am Ethan Campbell, a UK based software engineer specialising in full stack web development. I love working with people and seeing their ideas realized, which is a key part of my work.

### S o f t w a r e

My experience with software ranges from programming in Python to building and managing home server infastructure. Recently I've been leaning towards low level software, in particular, drivers & how computers interact with I/O. Starting from 13/08/2025 I multiple times a week compile my own software (mainly for better performance & customisability). [*see my blog on compilation*](/compilation)

### H a r d w a r e
My experience regarding computer hardware started with building desktop computers. To date I have built multiple computers ranging from LGA 771/LGA775 (Xeon X5450 Mod) to<br> my current desktop being an AM4 Ryzen build.
