## Club C 85 Vintage
These have been my goto daily wear trainers for the last year & a bit. I got a pair of vintages in Indonesia and wore them approx. 70% of the year and they have held up supringsly well. The trainers have a good combination of soft, supleness yet upholding its integrity and strength. Overtime they go from a similar top down silhouette of an Addidas Gazelle but overtime look more like a pair of Nike AF1s which I believe is due the leather stretching and becoming even more lax. After wearing dress shoes I find these shoes uncomfortable just because of how soft and comfortable they are !! Highly reccomended pair of kicks, especially considering their price and durability.

## Club C 85 Vintage '40th Anniverary'
Similar to the regular vintage model but instead has a gum sole, white upper & laces instead of the off-white & a suede inner lining over the towel. This pair feels significatly stiffer as compared to the 1 year old pair which is a testimony to how much the trainers soften over time. The box & accessories are quite a bit more exciting and provide a great value for the price they are (£90 retail/ £45 on sale).
